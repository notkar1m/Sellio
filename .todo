(update: i think its fixed but ill have to wait until tomorrow so i can restart the app and the changes can take effect)
(and also a potential solution might be to remove the part in the dump json that re assigns the variables so i want to try that to see if it soves the issue)
(for the now the temp fix is to save the variable in memory as a variable instaed of json)
make the db use mongodb instead of json
fix chat (i think the problem is that it takes more time to save json files on the server)
actually even just posting a listing is causing problems because of the file saving issue so i need to use mongodb 
compress listing images because they taek alot of time to load
add category specific specification in the creation like for example cpu clock speed, etc...
(maybe) phone number verifying
